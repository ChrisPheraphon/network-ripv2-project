# RIPv2 Network Simulation

This is a basic network simulation project using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Project Details:
- Routing protocol: RIPv2
- Devices: 3 routers, multiple VLANs, PCs
- Objective: Demonstrate dynamic routing between multiple subnets

## File:
- `Project 207 RIP.V2.pkt` â€” Packet Tracer project file

## How to use:
1. Open with Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Explore the topology and routing table
3. Try adding another router or subnet and observe how RIPv2 propagates routes
